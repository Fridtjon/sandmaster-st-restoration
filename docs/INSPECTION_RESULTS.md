## Restoration Log

### Session 1: Initial Inspection (2024-11-30)
- Transmitter had battery corrosion - cleaned with vinegar
- Receiver battery holder had NiCd leak - cleaned with vinegar
- Discovered crystal mismatch (TX: 27.045 MHz, RX: 26.995 MHz)
- Found power switch broken - bypassed for testing
- Confirmed servos work when receiver gets power

### Session 2: Parts Installation (2024-12-28)
- Washed truck exterior - much cleaner now
- Transmitter also cleaned - has glossy finish under the dirt
- Installed OS 8 glow plug - went smoothly
- Installed new air filter (slightly larger, fits OK)
- Replaced both crystals with matching 27.145 MHz pair
- Installed new battery holder with integrated switch
- **RADIO NOW FULLY WORKING** - both servos respond to TX!
- Antenna from AliExpress didn't fit (too thick for TX hole)
- Drained and cleaned fuel system with isopropanol (Blårens)
- Old fuel had turned to varnish/gunk (IPA turned blue-green)
- Flushed fuel filter - flows OK
- System disassembled and drying

## Parts Acquired

| Item | Source | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| OS 8 Glow Plug | Elefun | ✅ Installed |
| HPI Nitro Starter Pack | Elefun | ✅ Received |
| Fuel lines (spare) | Elefun | ✅ Received (not needed yet) |

## Antenna Issue

The M4 telescopic antenna purchased from AliExpress is too thick to fit through the antenna hole in the transmitter housing.

**Next steps:**
1. Try screwing the antenna onto the TX antenna mount to check if thread matches
2. Measure the hole diameter in the TX housing
3. Find a thinner antenna that fits
