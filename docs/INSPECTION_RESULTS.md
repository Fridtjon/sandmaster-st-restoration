## Restoration Log

### Session 1: Initial Inspection (2024-11-30)
- Transmitter had battery corrosion - cleaned with vinegar
- Receiver battery holder had NiCd leak - cleaned with vinegar
- Discovered crystal mismatch (TX: 27.045 MHz, RX: 26.995 MHz)
- Found power switch broken - bypassed for testing
- Confirmed servos work when receiver gets power

### Session 2: Parts Installation (2024-12-28)
- Washed truck exterior - much cleaner now
- Transmitter also cleaned - has glossy finish under the dirt
- Installed OS 8 glow plug - went smoothly
- Installed new air filter (slightly larger, fits OK)
- Replaced both crystals with matching 27.145 MHz pair
- Installed new battery holder with integrated switch
- **RADIO NOW FULLY WORKING** - both servos respond to TX!
- Antenna from AliExpress didn't fit (too thick for TX hole)
- Drained and cleaned fuel system with isopropanol (Blårens)
- Old fuel had turned to varnish/gunk (IPA turned blue-green)
- Flushed fuel filter - flows OK
- System disassembled and drying
- Pull starter issue: cord doesn't retract properly (weak spring or dirt buildup)
- Plan: lubricate with WD-40 before first start attempt

### Session 3: First Start Attempt (2025-12-31)
- Lubricated pull starter with WD-40
- Reassembled fuel system
- Filled with fresh 16% nitro fuel
- Glow starter charged and working (plug glows orange)
- Radio system working, servos responding

**Start attempt: UNSUCCESSFUL**

Observations:
- Fuel flows through lines to carburetor area
- Glow plug is dry - fuel not reaching combustion chamber
- Pull starter still sluggish despite WD-40 - hard to pull fast enough
- Fuel filter has minor leak (not introducing air)
- Possible minor leak near engine area

**Hypotheses:**
1. **Pull starter too weak** - Can't pull fast/hard enough to create proper suction
2. **Needle valve too lean** - Mixture screw may be closed too much
3. **Carburetor gummed up** - Old fuel residue may be blocking internal passages
4. **Compression/vacuum issue** - Not creating enough suction to draw fuel in

### Session 3 continued: Pull Starter Fix (2025-12-31)
- Disassembled pull starter unit (removed wheel to access screws)
- Found: cord/rope was heavily soiled and stiff from 30 years of dirt
- Cleaned all parts with isopropanol (IPA)
- Washed cord thoroughly - now soft and flexible again
- Reassembled pull starter
- **RESULT: Pull starter now works properly!** Spring returns cord without issues
- Comparison to old photos shows cord now hangs with natural slack (was stiff before)
- Plan: Apply silicone spray tomorrow for optimal lubrication

**Root cause identified:** The dirty/stiff cord was preventing the spring from retracting properly. Cleaning restored full function.

### Session 4: Pull Starter Complete (2026-01-02)
- Cleaned pull starter cord and mechanism with isopropanol
- Applied silicone spray for lubrication
- Reassembled pull starter
- **RESULT: Pull starter now works perfectly!** Cord returns smoothly and easily
- Ready for second start attempt

### Session 5: FIRST SUCCESSFUL START! (2026-01-17)

**ENGINE STARTED SUCCESSFULLY!** 🎉

After several pulls with proper technique (glow plug fully heated), the engine fired up and ran!

**Observations:**
- Starting worked well once technique was mastered - glow plug must be fully hot (glowing orange)
- Engine consumed fuel quickly (running rich, plus some leaks)
- Fuel leaked from glow plug area - needs to be tightened properly
- Exhaust produced vapor/steam where it hit surfaces (normal - water vapor + unburnt nitro)
- Tested on balcony in apartment building - had to stop quickly due to noise

**Needle valve notes:**
- Small metal screw controls fuel mixture
- Counter-clockwise = richer (more fuel), clockwise = leaner (less fuel)
- User attempted to stop engine by closing needle valve - felt "loose" at end of travel
- WARNING: Never run engine with needle valve fully closed (too lean = overheating)

**Shutdown attempts:**
- Fuel tank has a shut-off button/valve - didn't seem to work
- Eventually stopped engine by pulling out fuel line (works but not ideal)
- Proper methods: pinch fuel line, or cover exhaust opening

**Drivetrain observation:**
- Wheels did not spin at idle - this is NORMAL!
- Nitro RC cars have centrifugal clutch - only engages when engine revs up
- Need to test with throttle to verify drivetrain works

**Next steps:**
- Tighten glow plug properly
- Learn proper shutdown technique
- Test drivetrain with throttle (find suitable outdoor location)
- Consider needle valve adjustment if running too rich

## Remaining Tasks

### Engine Running - ACHIEVED!
| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Drain old fuel | ✅ Done |
| Reassemble fuel system | ✅ Done |
| Fill with fresh fuel | ✅ Done |
| Charge glow starter | ✅ Done |
| First start attempt | ❌ Failed - fuel not reaching combustion chamber |
| Fix pull starter | ✅ Done - cleaned, cord was stiff from dirt |

### Current Issues
| Task | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Tighten glow plug | High - fuel leaking |
| Test drivetrain with throttle | High - verify wheels spin |
| Learn proper shutdown technique | Medium |
| Adjust needle valve if needed | Medium - running rich |
| Replace fuel filter | Low - minor leak |
| Find fitting TX antenna | Low |

### Nice to Have
| Task | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Fine-clean transmitter | Low |
| Inspect one-way bearing | Low |

## Parts Acquired

| Item | Source | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| OS 8 Glow Plug | Elefun | ✅ Installed |
| HPI Nitro Starter Pack | Elefun | ✅ Received |
| Fuel lines (spare) | Elefun | ✅ Received (not needed yet) |
| Air filter | ? | ✅ Installed |
| 27.145 MHz Crystal Pair | AliExpress | ✅ Installed |
| Battery holder + switch | AliExpress | ✅ Installed |
| M4 Antenna | AliExpress | ❌ Doesn't fit (too thick) |
| Nitro fuel 16% (2.5L) | ? | ✅ Ready |

---

## Antenna Issue

The M4 telescopic antenna purchased from AliExpress is too thick to fit through the antenna hole in the transmitter housing.

**Next steps:**
1. Try screwing the antenna onto the TX antenna mount to check if thread matches
2. Measure the hole diameter in the TX housing
3. Find a thinner antenna that fits
