## Action Items

### Must Fix Before Running
1. **Buy glow plug** - Engine cannot fire without it
2. **Clean transmitter corrosion** - Radio won't work otherwise
3. **Drain old fuel** - Old nitro turns to varnish
4. **Buy fresh nitro fuel** - Need 16-20% nitromethane

### Should Buy/Have Ready
- Glow starter/igniter (to start engine)
- AA batteries for transmitter (8x) ✅ Have
- Receiver battery pack (4.8V)

### Nice to Fix
- Pull starter return spring (works but weak)
- Inspect one-way bearing (clicking sound)

## Next Session Goals
1. Clean transmitter battery contacts
