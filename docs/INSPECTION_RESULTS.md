## Restoration Log

### Session 1: Initial Inspection (2024-11-30)
- Transmitter had battery corrosion - cleaned with vinegar
- Receiver battery holder had NiCd leak - cleaned with vinegar
- Discovered crystal mismatch (TX: 27.045 MHz, RX: 26.995 MHz)
- Found power switch broken - bypassed for testing
- Confirmed servos work when receiver gets power

### Session 2: Parts Installation (2024-12-28)
- Washed truck exterior - much cleaner now
- Transmitter also cleaned - has glossy finish under the dirt
- Installed OS 8 glow plug - went smoothly
- Installed new air filter (slightly larger, fits OK)
- Replaced both crystals with matching 27.145 MHz pair
- Installed new battery holder with integrated switch
- **RADIO NOW FULLY WORKING** - both servos respond to TX!
- Antenna from AliExpress didn't fit (too thick for TX hole)
- Drained and cleaned fuel system with isopropanol (Blårens)
- Old fuel had turned to varnish/gunk (IPA turned blue-green)
- Flushed fuel filter - flows OK
- System disassembled and drying
- Pull starter issue: cord doesn't retract properly (weak spring or dirt buildup)
- Plan: lubricate with WD-40 before first start attempt

## Remaining Tasks

### Before First Start
| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Drain old fuel | ✅ Done - cleaned with IPA |
| Lubricate pull starter | ⏳ Pending - buy WD-40 |
| Reassemble fuel system | ⏳ Drying, then reassemble |
| Fill with fresh fuel | ⏳ Ready when reassembled |
| Charge glow starter | ⏳ Pending - USB charge overnight |
| First start attempt | ⏳ Ready when above complete |
| Find fitting TX antenna | ⏳ Low priority - can test without |

### Nice to Have
| Task | Priority |
|------|----------|
| Fine-clean transmitter | Low |
| Inspect one-way bearing | Low |
| Replace pull starter spring | Low |

## Parts Acquired

| Item | Source | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| OS 8 Glow Plug | Elefun | ✅ Installed |
| HPI Nitro Starter Pack | Elefun | ✅ Received |
| Fuel lines (spare) | Elefun | ✅ Received (not needed yet) |
| Air filter | ? | ✅ Installed |
| 27.145 MHz Crystal Pair | AliExpress | ✅ Installed |
| Battery holder + switch | AliExpress | ✅ Installed |
| M4 Antenna | AliExpress | ❌ Doesn't fit (too thick) |

## Antenna Issue

The M4 telescopic antenna purchased from AliExpress is too thick to fit through the antenna hole in the transmitter housing.

**Next steps:**
1. Try screwing the antenna onto the TX antenna mount to check if thread matches
2. Measure the hole diameter in the TX housing
3. Find a thinner antenna that fits
