# Nitro RC Basics Guide

Complete guide for starting and running the 1994 Kyosho Sandmaster ST with GS11X engine.

## What You Need to Run a Nitro RC Car

### Essential Equipment

| Item | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Nitro fuel | Powers the engine | 16-20% nitromethane recommended |
| Glow starter/igniter | Heats glow plug for starting | 1.2V rechargeable recommended |
| Transmitter batteries | Powers radio controller | 8x AA for Hitec Ranger II |
| Receiver battery | Powers servos and receiver | 4-cell NiMH pack (4.8V) |
| Spare glow plugs | Consumable item | Keep 2-3 on hand |

### Fuel Requirements

**Recommended fuel composition:**
- 16-20% nitromethane content (ideal for GS11X)
- 8-12% oil content (synthetic or synthetic/castor blend)

**Good brands:**
- Traxxas Top Fuel (beginner-friendly)
- PowerMaster
- Byron Originals
- VP Racing RC Pro Race

**Storage:** Keep sealed, cool, and dry. Methanol absorbs moisture from air.

## How a Nitro Engine Starts

1. **Glow plug** contains a platinum wire coil
2. **Glow starter** supplies 1.2V to heat the coil until it glows orange
3. **Pull starter** compresses fuel/air mixture
4. **Ignition** occurs from the hot glow plug
5. **Catalytic reaction** between platinum and methanol keeps plug hot
6. **Remove glow starter** - engine runs on its own

## Starting Procedure

### Pre-Start Checklist
- [ ] Transmitter ON first (check batteries)
- [ ] Receiver/vehicle ON second
- [ ] Test steering and throttle response
- [ ] Fill fuel tank
- [ ] Fresh glow plug installed

### Starting Steps
1. Prime engine: Open throttle, block exhaust, pull starter until fuel reaches carburetor
2. Return throttle to idle position
3. Attach glow starter firmly to glow plug
4. Pull starter cord smoothly (don't yank)
5. Once engine fires, remove glow starter
6. Let idle 30 seconds to warm up

### Shutting Down
1. Pinch fuel line or block exhaust to stop engine
2. Turn off vehicle/receiver FIRST
3. Turn off transmitter SECOND

## Basic Tuning

### The Two Needles

| Needle | Controls | Location |
|--------|----------|----------|
| High-Speed (HSN) | Full throttle mixture | Usually on top of carb |
| Low-Speed (LSN) | Idle and low RPM mixture | Usually on side of carb |

### Tuning Direction
- **Clockwise (in)** = Leaner (less fuel) = Hotter, more power, risk of damage
- **Counter-clockwise (out)** = Richer (more fuel) = Cooler, less power, safer

### Golden Rule
**Always start rich and gradually lean.** Running lean destroys engines.

### Signs of Rich vs Lean

| Too Rich | Too Lean |
|----------|----------|
| Lots of blue smoke | Little/no smoke |
| Bogs at full throttle | Dies at full throttle |
| Never reaches top speed | Overheats |
| Sputters | Glow plug turns white |

### Factory Starting Points
1. Seat both needles gently (don't force)
2. HSN: Back out 2.5-3 turns
3. LSN: Back out 1.5-2 turns

### Target Temperature
- **Ideal:** 200-250°F (93-121°C)
- **Too hot (>260°F):** Richen immediately!

## Engine Break-In

**If the engine has never been run or sat for 30 years, consider break-in:**

1. Run engine very rich (lots of blue smoke)
2. Idle and low throttle only for first 2 tanks
3. Gradually increase throttle over 4-5 tanks
4. Heat cycle method: Run 2-3 min, cool completely, repeat 10x
5. Replace glow plug after break-in

## Battery Requirements

### Transmitter (Hitec Ranger II)
- 8x AA batteries (alkaline or NiCad rechargeable)
- Check indicator before each session

### Receiver
- 4-cell pack (4.8V) - original used AA holder
- Modern: 4-cell NiMH 1500-2000mAh recommended
- Must have JR/JST connector

## Safety

### Fuel Handling
- Methanol is **toxic and flammable**
- Wear gloves and safety glasses
- Work in ventilated areas
- Keep away from heat/sparks
- Never pour down drains

### Operating
- Always transmitter ON first, OFF last
- Don't touch exhaust (extremely hot)
- Run in open areas away from people
- Expect crashes while learning

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Won't start | Dead glow plug | Replace glow plug |
| Won't start | Flooded | Remove plug, invert car, pull starter |
| Dies at full throttle | Too lean | Richen HSN 1/4 turn |
| Bogs on acceleration | Too rich | Lean LSN 1/8 turn |
| Overheating | Too lean | Richen both needles |
| Won't idle | LSN too lean | Richen LSN 1/8 turn |

## Maintenance Schedule

**After every run:**
- Wipe down vehicle
- Check loose screws

**Every 3-4 runs:**
- Clean air filter
- Inspect for wear

**Monthly:**
- Deep clean
- Replace glow plug
- Check all components
